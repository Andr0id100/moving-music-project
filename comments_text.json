Everyone turned against each other. And I tried to keep the peace but I got crushed by the stress of it resulting in me nearly taking my own life. I was recovering from a major emotional low point when a new fight erupted among two of those friends, and I didn\u2019t know what to do. I just laid in my floor crying as both friends talked trash about each other. That\u2019s when the first of the songs came on. Then I heard No Surprises while I was in even worse shape and it just tore me apart inside.

It just brought even more pain to me as I realized that it was one of the last recordings of him. It made me regret it all. Everything I did and said.

I would advise you to listen to it for yourself, but if you don't care to here's a brief summary:**\n\nThe premise of the song is that the singer mistook someone they saw on the street for someone special to them who is no longer in their life.  The regular topics and themes of similar songs will lead you to believe it's about a woman, a former lover, ex girlfriend, or wife.\n\nThe chorus goes like this: \n\n*\"Yesterday, was that you? Looked just like you*\n\n*Strange things my imagination might do*\n\n*Take a breath, reflect on what we've been through*\n\n*Or am I just going crazy \u2018cause I miss you?\"*\n\nThe whole song is about the regrets of the singer, his actions seemingly leading to the breakup\/lack of contact.  He talks about all the things he would do differently given the chance.  \n\nAt the end of the last verse of the song, the singer reveals his true intent that he left vague until this moment:\n\n*\"Never thought about the world without you*\n\n*And I promise that I'll never say another bad word about you*\n\n*I thought I saw you yesterday*\n\n*But I know it wasn't you, \u2018cause you passed away, Dad\"*\n\nWhile he sings the last chorus, you barely hear it because you recount everything he said and realize it never was about a woman.  Everything he said fits and coincides with it being about his deceased father, and the fact that he thought he saw him yesterday goes from being a \"coulda been them\" to hallucinating from grief.  \n\nIt's a terrific song.","404":"Independence Day by Martina McBride","405":"I Can\u2019t Make You Love Me - Bonnie Raitt\n\nUgh.

The first two verses are Stan's increasingly worrying letters, and in the third verse, he records himself talking while he drives himself and his pregnant wife off of a bridge and they all die. In the fourth verse, Eminem finally responds, and gives Stan the advice that he needed, but realizes at the end that his advice has come too late and Stan has already killed himself. It's coupled with a music video that just illustrates everything that happens in the video. When I was first getting into music, I saw it and it was just so sad that I cried.

Sara, Beautiful Child, and Storms are all absolutely gorgeous songs that make me tear up a little and Sisters of the Moon is just a total banger. I think it's kind of uneven (most of it isn't really Christine McVie's best work, though I really love Brown Eyes and Over & Over, and think Honey Hi is really sweet), but I think Lindsey Buckingham's experimentation pays off too! I love the batshit energy of Tusk and the Ledge.","2240":"Waiting on June - Holly Williams , about the lives of her grandparents, from the time they meet until her grandpa dies.

After describing the shared revelry and the return to the norm of war, McCutcheon's character muses \"the question haunted every heart that beat that wondrous night: whose family have I fixed within my sights?\"","2773":"Happier by marshmello. It came on the radio a couple hours after we dropped my little brother off at the airport so he could go to a rehab across the country","2774":"Cancer by My Chemical Romance\n\nI pretty much only listened to classic, alternative, punk, and hard rock, was definitely not into the pop, rap, and emo music of the '00s. Cancer is mostly piano, though, and who honestly hates the piano (I'm sure there's some of you, but in general)? Even so, I didn't know who sang that song at the time but it moved me to tears the first time and motivated me to listen to a few of their other songs afterwards (because Cancer is nothing like the rest of their music). \n\nMCR has been a notable exception to a lot of people's tastes even if they  don't like emo\/pop, but regardless, as it turns out after listening to a few of their songs and then buying almost all of their albums.. I apparently love emo music. Panic!, Meriwether, HIM, Funeral For a Friend, Yellowcard, Paramore, Fallout Boy, Dashboard Confessional, etc; realized that punk rock wasn't specifically the anti-establishment genre, all rock is anti-establishment, punk rock is just the emo offshoot of rock.","2775":"Moonlight Sonata by Beethoven","2776":"Downpour by IOI\n\nI had heard IOI a few times before and liked their sound so I eventually decided to really look into their music, only to listen to this song and realize they had already disbanded. Idk what it is but discovering a new artist and starting to fall in love with their sound only to realize they're gone is kinda heartbreaking. I can only imagine what their established fans were feeling.\n\nEdit: the first time I watched it, I teared up because it sounded so beautiful and I'm a sucker for ballads. The second time, I watched the MV they made which covered them from their training days to their cute everyday moments to their final days.

I will even assure them that yes, the song title is accurate and it is literally about a cat.  They're like \"Come on, dude.  A cat?'\n\nIt's hard to explain.  There are songs that hit you like a ton of bricks and leave you depressed or just so emotionally spent that it's like you can't do anything for an hour afterwards. But that stuff doesn't make me physically cry, it just bums me out.\n\nBut Virtute the Cat Explains Her Departure... it's less powerful than it is like a prefectly placed sucker punch straight to the feels that provokes an instant and involuntary biochemical reaction. Like I literally did not realize I was crying when I first heard it.  I was just like \"Man, this is really good song.  I like this.... hey, what's wrong with my eye?\"\n\nNow, if you actually listen to the complete Virtute the Cat song cycle, that actually can wreck you and leave you depressed for hours.  But I'm just saying that Virtute the Cat Explains Her Departure as a standalone song can just make people cry even out of context.  Even if you're only halfway paying attention to the lyrics.  Even if you've been warned.  Even if you bet $10 you wouldn't cry.","2803":"Saturn - Sleeping at Last","2804":"Anyone - Demi Lovato","2805":"If We Have Each Other by Alec Benjamin.

I'm not saying this just cause I'm an ARMY, I'm saying this cause it actually happened. \n\nWhen the song came out, I had hust come home from school, andnit was a pretty, long and tiring day. It wasn't just tiring, it was also pretty mentally and emotionally draining, so all I wanted to do was just...sleep. I suddenly remembered that BTS had a Japanese single coming out, so I quickly went on to Youtube to check it out. Everytime I watch a foreign music video, I watch and listen first, before I do just that again but while reading the subtitles. The first run was already powerful and emotional. I didn't understand anything but the \"I'm your light, you're my light\" part, so that made me cry, cause idk, I guess knowing that I, along with the rest of the BTS ARMY have given BTS their light; while at the same time, they're doing everything they can to become OUR light. I guess it's just nice to know that the genuine care and love you give someone is reciprocated I guess. Thats just my interpretation of the song though","3032":"Green Day- Wake me up when september ends\nand\nStarset - Ricochet (my (ex)crush sent me this after we had a very bad argument, so its lyrics makes me cry everytime)","3033":"I'm the type of guy who never gets choked up for movies, but some songs have done it for me.

Its about a teenager who committed suicide. One of their fans iirc. Every time I hear it though I think of a good friend of mine. Me and him were the \"therapists\" of outlr group of friends. I kindof blame myself. I moved away and he killed himself shortly after. I was his \"therapist\" and he was mine. It kept us balanced with having to deal with the other people in our groups problems. \n\nThe part of the song that gets me the hardest is probably this :\n\nSo I'll sing\n\nFor the weak\n\nFor the broken, those in need\n\nAnd I'll keep\n\nMy heart in reach\n\nLeft wide open, set you free\n\nYou were loved!\n\nAs much as my life sucks now I'm forcing myself to press on in his memory.

I would try to not think that kinda thing, but I couldn\u2019t help it, so I gave up. I was never suicidal, but I may have been heading down that road.\n\nLong story short, one day I was sitting in my room, exploring music, and I got an ad for Holding on to You\u2019s music video. I had already heard twenty one pilots before, so I just kept listening. The beat was awesome and the chorus was beautiful. But during the second verse was the following lyrics:\n\nRemember the moment\nYou know exactly where you\u2019re going\nCuz the next moment before you know it\nTime is slowing\nAnd it\u2019s frozen still\nAnd the window sill looks really nice, right?\nYou think twice about your life\nIt probably happens at night, right?\nFight it, take the pain, ignite it\nTie a noose around your mind\nLoose enough to breath fine\nAnd tie it to a tree\nTell it\n\u201cYou belong to me, this ain\u2019t a noose this is a leash and I have news for you\nYou must obey me.\u201d\n\nI broke down. I listened to Car Radio and Migraine after that. The reason was because, even though it was, and still is, hard to always have control of what I think, I can do it. But most importantly, as Migraine reminded me, I\u2019m not alone. People are going through the same struggles I was, and am.

He'd been struggling with depression for a while and I had tried to probe his mind about those struggles, but never got through until after his attempt. I found him having taken half a bottle of opioids and collapsed in the living room, and called EMS.\n\nThis song reminds me of him and the real vulnerable moment he and I shared when he opened up to me in the hospital after I called the ambulance. He told me all about his mental health struggles. I remembered the weeks prior seeing him emotionless and zombie-like and me asking him to talk, and he'd just sit there. The song can be really taken many ways, but that's how I relate to it. I just remember we woke up one Saturday after he discharged and was stable on medication and just sat around on the couch the entire weekend in our boxers watching movies and ordering pizza, and just seeing in his face how therapeutic it was. The song just takes me back to that weekend and it is such a great memory and reminder of how much i appreciate him in my life. So yeah, definitely check the song out!","3325":"21 Years by Tobymac.

I\u2019ve heard most of the popular songs in this thread and none of them compare to the overwhelming sense of pain and loss he manages to so perfectly portray...it\u2019s a rare gift to be able to take that pain and make something beautiful of it.

I first heard it in the anime it was written for (Made in Abyss) and it sent chills down my spine. For the first time in a long time I was moved to tears, and it still has that effect on me today.\n\nThose familiar with the source material will know the horrific realities of its world. And when this song cuts in it just kind of turns that grimdark dystopia into something otherworldly and incredibly beautiful.\n\nOn it's own, the song manages to tell a story with lyrics sung in a language that doesn't actually exist.

Cry every time.","3438":"Elton John - The Greatest Discovery. Bernie Taupin's lyrics about an older brother discovering his baby brother for the first time. Incredibly beautiful, but there's something in the phrasing of the last verse that just slaughters me","3439":"Yesterday by Atmosphere.

It's a really long song (full version is about 11 minutes long) about growing up in New York City - which was going through really rough times in the 1970s (and into the 1980s).  But it was written in the early 1970s and while it starts out happy (NYC in the 1940's, 50's and 60's) it ends sadly with \"A Friend is Dying\" which is about seeing a thing you love (NYC) - a vibrant and happy living place - being turned into a bankrupt dying empty shell of its former self.\n\nThe four songs that make up the Suite are:\"Sweet City Song,\" \"Hello Jack,\" \"All Around The Town,\" \"A Friend Is Dying.\"\n\nI always think of this song being about a person and it allows me to remember the good times and not focus on the death of that person.\n\nDo yourself a favor and check out the long version at\n\n[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Xq0Cbtj\\_utY](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Xq0Cbtj_utY)\n\nFrom the Songfacts website:  Cashman & West were Terry Cashman and Tommy West. Cashman wrote it about his home town of New York City. In our [interview with Terry Cashman](https:\/\/www.songfacts.com\/blog\/interviews\/terry-cashman), he told us: \"It was actually four songs strung together as a suite. Tommy and I signed as an act, Cashman & West, with ABC Dunhill. We had written a number of songs, but I really wanted to do something that would be special for the album. And it was a very sad time for me. A lot of my friends were leaving the city and going off, getting married, and you know, things were changing. I was 30 years old, and New York where I had grown up all my life was really deteriorating. It was a very bad time financially, and it was a time of turmoil and of racial strife. It looked like the city was gonna collapse. This great place where I had grown up and enjoyed so many friendships and so many good times - the city that I love - was actually dying. I was going into our office the next day, and I said to Tommy, 'I had this thought about New York in particular, but it's really happening to all the Eastern cities. They're decaying and white people are moving out of the cities and going to the suburbs. There are only very rich people and very poor people in the cities, and homelessness.' We started talking about the whole phenomenon, and we came up with this idea to do a song about how it was, which was the first movement of the first song of the suite was called, 'Sweet City Song,' and it was very happy, it was about growing up in a city where everyone got along and it was fun to be there - rock and roll was in the air. And then tracing that through, going away to school and coming back and seeing that things had changed, and then the third movement is an up-tempo song about how things were at that particular time as opposed to ten years before. And then it goes into 'A Friend Is Dying,' which is the last movement of 'American City Suite,' which is about the city dying. And that's the way it seemed to us at the time. That it was not only New York City, but all the Eastern industrial cities were having the same problems.\"","3731":"[\u201cSing About Me, I\u2019m Dying of Thirst\u201d by Kendrick Lamar](https:\/\/youtu.be\/Z3CnfFQENkw)","3732":"Speed Trap Town by Jason Isbell","3733":"Colloquy by Whiskey Myers.

The music and vocals weave a beautifully tragic image in my mind of someone trapped in a dark pit of their own grief, unable to find their way back to the light.

I don\u2019t think there are many singers who can make me feel things the same way he did.\n\nI can\u2019t bring up Alice In Chains without mentioning Nutshell.  The music is stripped down quite a bit compared to their more well known songs.  Layne is not doing his powerful belting like on Man In The Box.  It feels like Layne is pouring his heart into this song.  Every line is important, but the end of the song is what puts a knot in my gut.  \u201cAnd yet I find repeating in my head - if I can\u2019t be my own, I\u2019d feel better dead.\u201d  That line stuck with me and is what ended up giving me the push I needed to leave an abusive relationship.  It led me to thinking if I can\u2019t see my friends and family and have to be stuck in this miserable situation, I would rather be dead.  Screw it, I\u2019m making a big change for me.

I notice in myself that I get really touched by a song, when I can connect with the singer on a weird level. It's like the person knows my sorrows and has a far better way to say them out loud. I think emotions are the trigger (obviously). So it really depends on the context in which the song is played in. How are you feeling, while the song plays, or how where you feeling the last couple days\/ weeks\/ months? Now the artist was bold enough to say exactly those thoughts out loud, that you were too afraid to notice or share with others. The artist was not afraid of pain and you are inspired by that bravery or you feel glad that somebody finally understands you. It also really depends on wether you are with people or alone, is the sound device good? Alone with a good sound device offer the best setting for a song to be fully enjoyed. Is the artist a master in their craft? Sometimes years of dedication or just raw talent can be so impressive, they move us to tears. Also do you know the background story? Did you read something about the artists past, that makes their words cristal clear now (honestly if you pay attention, you can basically learn everything about an artist through their songs, they just write it down in their songs)? Or maybe does your friend make music and wrote a really touching song about his\/ her feelings? Or in a movie, if everything's right, the story, the characters, the acting, the music... then you can be really touched. And what usually will occupy or minds the most will be the strongest emotions. Pain, love, loss, self pity... Now if a famous singer that you know has had a hard childhood with his father and you also struggle with your father and now you're alone in your room in the dark, after a long day, and you suddenly hear a song from that artist, beautiful voice and just with acoustic guitar or piano, singing out their soul about their pain from their childhood, while you were sleepless the last nights, thinking about the pain that was done to you... and voila! There goes the waterfall. \n\nMusic has something really strong and is one of the reasons life is worth living. And what I'm trying to say is, that there are powerful songs and there are not so powerful ones. But what makes people cry about a song has a lot to do with context and relatability. So a song that means a lot to me and made me cry, can be the most boring shit to you. \n\nOn that note, let me present you my boring shit:\n\n[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EA68KUb4e7Q](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EA68KUb4e7Q)\n\nI'm still here from the Treasure planet.

I got a little teary-eyed (so, I didn't outright cry), but I can easily go years without crying, so that was quite an exceptional experience. I've listened to it many times since, but it doesn't have the same affect as that first time.

Made me cry because the lyrics spoke to the moment I was in.","5530":"The Days Have Turned - John Frusciante\n\nHe's got a lot of tracks that resonate with me emotionally, but this one gets me good. I would like to record a cover but I can almost never get through it without a crack in my voice and a few tears. It really hits on some of the kind of things you think in a depressive state, takes me to some dark memories but also helps remind me i'm not there anymore which is a beautiful thing.","5531":"Kiss From A Rose by Seal.

This song is about his father who he never knew because he was killed by the Rwandan genocide. In my interpretation, it's about how he misses a father in his life who could teach him how to be a dad and a man. It really makes me feel that fatherhood is underappreciated these days for emotional bonding.","5919":"[\"We'll Be Together Again\"](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=W-JXRQlD18c).

Good album and a solid ending in that song.","5925":"It Knows Me by Avi Kaplan made me sob my eyeliner off the other day.

Last year, I had to step away from a relationship with her and pause communication because it had reached a really unhealthy level. After several months of not seeing her or speaking to her, we started counseling together. \n\nShe was finally able to understand and accept some of the abuse and trauma she had put me through, which was a huge turning point. She then started doing individual counseling in addition to sessions with me, and she drastically changed for the better. When I heard that song, it was basically my moms new outlook and everything she was trying to communicate to me in sessions put into a song. I bawled instantly when hearing it and still cry when it comes on. \n\nMy mom and I speak to each other now and see each other, we reached a point where we learned healthy communication outside of the counseling office and she was able to get individual help to break some unhealthy cycles of her own.

I think it was written for along lost love rather to suicide or growing apart, it\u2019s sung by a woman to a woman so the context of it being a queer love ballad just makes it so much more deep. The song is sung like a search light in the middle of the darkest night-quiet but piercing.","6029":"Rainy Song by Tomoya Naka.

The \u201cI love you song\u201d from that show.\n\nEach character uses their given word as a springboard into their solos, and all of them are very amusing.  Then there is the I Love You Song.\n\nThe actress is given word chimerical, which means wildly fanciful; highly unrealistic. Which prompts her to sing about how her mother left her, and her dad takes out his aggression on her, and perhaps if she wins the spelling bee, her family will love her.  Two other actors come on stage as her parents and do nothing but tell her how proud they are of her, and how much they love her.  It\u2019s absolutely heartbreaking and beautiful.

Ugly cried","6492":"Tears in heaven - Eric Clapton","6493":"Dance with my father - Luther Vandross\n\nSo emotional when you listen to the words and just makes me very every time","6494":"Brothers in arms - Dire straits","6495":"Voodoo Child Blues by Jimi Hendrix with a little psylocybin to really drive it home","6496":"Heroin by The Velvet Underground. every damn time.","6497":"Bittersweet Symphony - The Verve\n\nI don\u2019t know, it just fucking gets me every single time.  Also, Lucky Man - ELP","6498":"The general - dispatch","6499":"Coney Island Baby - Lou Reed. \n\nI discovered Lou when I first got to college, and I became quickly fascinated with him. He was this bitter, angry sonofabitch who chewed people out in interviews and at his shows. Possibly the biggest asshole to anybody who met him, but he also made the most visceral, intelligent, and profound music (especially during his time with The Velvet Underground).\n\nSo I was totally surprised when I got to his soft-rock album, really unlike all his previous works (the album before this one was pure metallic feedback). It was smooth and kinda jazzy, but it was the title track that caught me off-guard. Lou starts singing about wanting to play football in high school, about wanting to be apart of something. And I quickly realized this angry motherf*cker was just a scared, insecure kid who always wanted to fit in but never knew how to.\n\nI started sobbing near the end, and it always gets me every damn time I listen to it. It's a swooning anthem to people who have always felt they've been left out, but it ends with a promise that \"the glory of love will see you through.\" That people can and will see you for who you are, and they'll accept you. Easily one of the best songs he's written and one I cherish immensely.","6500":"Washer by Slint. Not a very well known song but probably the saddest song I know of.

My mother died shortly after Christmas six years ago without warning and I think I heard this sometime during the year afterwards. The shock of losing her so suddenly took a massive toll on me and this song helped me to confront my grief and realise I\u2019d been hiding from my feelings.\n\nHis chorus includes a list of his relatives he spends Christmas with on the beach, including his mum. I will never have any more Christmases with my mum, on a beach or otherwise.\n\nIt hurts like a knife to my chest when I hear the song, and that line yet I can\u2019t resist it. In fact I don\u2019t want to resist because I know that not facing up to how I am is unhealthy and detrimental to those around me.\n\n[Let it break your heart too](https:\/\/youtu.be\/fCNvZqpa-7Q)","6513":"Hybrid Rainbow - The Pillows","6514":"swimming in the flood by passion pit","6515":"Almost Blue - Chet Baker","6516":"Pool party by julia jacklin.

Every time she's tried to get clean she's always relapsed and has never really been in her life these last 6 years. Similarly, my mom's brother has been in a similar situation for as long as I can remember, going in and out of rehab but never staying clean. My mom has given up on him and I tell my girlfriend she has to do the same with her mom because she's never going to change, and she can't let that hurt her anymore. The first time I sat down and listened to the lyrics, I cried my eyes out thinking of everything my girlfriend has been through, and how her mom has been a junkie for her whole life and how she never had a mom because of drugs. I heard it again on the radio and I had to pull over because I was crying so hard.","6529":"Deadly Dull by Movements.

My family moved a lot when I was younger, so the house I lived in during high school (and on breaks from college) was the first I'd stayed in for any significant amount of time. It represented permanence, and despite it being host to a lot of crap, it was also the place where who I am now, and who I imagine I'll be or become for the foreseeable future. The days after we moved in kind of blur together, but one of the first, poignant memories I have of the period (before Afghanistan and the divorce, and before \"high school\" as a monolith kind of cemented itself) was sitting down to study and putting on a playlist of midis that started with a variant of this song (The Name of Life). I recognized consciously, later, that it was a song that had woven it's way into my overall sense of life in that house. \n\nSo, on the day we moved out, I went down to the basement, pulled up this Youtube page on my phone, put my earbuds in, and walked through the entire place while it played through. I imagined all the things that had happened in the 7 years we'd been there, as I passed by every room, until I got to my bedroom, which was in the opposite corner of the house. I stood there for a second, closed my eyes and took a deep breath, and as I exhaled and opened them to the empty floor and bare walls, the song ended. That abrupt, unfinished phrase did me in. I broke down right then and there.","7926":"i've posted like 5 songs to this thread already lol.

We were just its messengers... Its biological catylysts. It's core is a complete mystery to me... and ...you know, I wouldn't ever try to write something that hopeless... All of our saddest songs have somewhere in them at least a glimmer of resolve... 'Street Spirit' has no resolve... It is the dark tunnel without the light at the end. It represents all tragic emotion that is so hurtful that the sound of that melody is its only definition. We all have a way of dealing with that song... It's called detachment... Especially me.. I detach my emotional radar from that song, or I couldn't play it... I'd crack. I'd break down on stage.. that's why its lyrics are just a bunch of mini-stories or visual images as opposed to a cohesive explanation of its meaning... I used images set to the music that I thought would convey the emotional entirety of the lyric and music working together... That's what's meant by 'all these things are one to swallow whole'.. I meant the emotional entirety, because I didn't have it in me to articulate the emotion... (pause) I'd crack.... Our fans are braver than I to let that song penetrate them, or maybe they don't realize what they're listening to.. They don't realize that 'Street Spirit' is about staring the fucking devil right in the eyes... and knowing, no matter what the hell you do, he'll get the last laugh...and it's real...and true. The devil really will get the last laugh in all cases without exception, and if I let myself think about that to long, I'd crack. I can't believe we have fans that can deal emotionally with that song... That's why I'm convinced that they don't know what it's about. It's why we play it towards the end of our sets. It drains me, and it shakes me, and hurts like hell everytime I play it, looking out at thousands of people cheering and smiling, oblivious to the tragedy of it's meaning, like when you're going to have your dog put down and it's wagging it's tail on the way there.

I have to say [At Zanarkand](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=h-0G_FI61a8), from the Final Fantasy X OST. When I was 12, my 17 year old brother was diagnosed with a lung disease and died within four months of hospitalisation. He was my hero and, as we had an often absent father, my brother was my main male role model, and his death affected me in quite a serious way that I still haven't recovered from (This December will be the 10 year anniversary of his death).\n\nI think anyone who has an older brother will be able to identify with the idolisation you have towards them. It's hard to put into words without it sounding corny or slightly bizarre, but really, a huge part of my personality was formed from following his cues - whatever videogames he liked, they were the best games around to me, whatever music he liked was definitely the coolest music... As I was becoming a teenager I was beginning to develop my own tastes more, but I was really still a kid when he died so I never really understood him as anything but my example to follow.\n\nFinal Fantasy X was a great example of this. I remember a lot of times when I played videogames as I kid, I was too scared to play them a lot of time, and I'm not talking about horror games, basically any challenging game I would be too scared to play because I was terrified of dying, losing the game, etc... I would endlessly repeat tutorial levels, introduction sections, because when I got to unfamiliar stages I would feel so intimidated. I think a lot of kids feel that way. So I used to love watching Mike play, because I got to see all these cool stages of the game, it was like watching a movie. I must have played the opening section of FFX about 10 times, just getting to the part where Sin attacks Zanarkand, maybe running around Besaid a bit and then restarting, but I would be glued when Mike was playing on his save, and I'd be upset if I missed progress (Obviously I was 11ish at this point so I didn't act like it bothered me to him, but it did.). I also used to watch this cinematic so many times, if you know the game, when you leave it idle at the start menu it plays this cinematic of Tidus and the party at the ruins of Zanarkand, and this music plays. It became really ingrained in my mind because I loved the world and stuff, so I loved watching this cinematic. If you have played the game, you'll understand the emotional significance of this scene. If you haven't, well... The main character finds out the world he has lived in his whole life has been an illusion, and he is thrust into the real world, and he travels to his home city, Zanarkand, to find it is a ruins, and has been for (thousands of?) years. The Zanarkand he knows and was raised in hasn't existed for a long time. ( [http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=sqIVSyAine4](Here) is the cinematic for those interested).\n\nThe whole soundtrack is absolutely incredible, but this track stands out. After my brother died, I found out that my dad wasn't just working abroad in his long periods of absence, he was also having affairs, and my parents have since split up, and we had to sell my childhood home and me and my mum moved into a tiny house together, my dad moved to the other side of the world with his new partner. That's just the main bullet point of the problems I've had lately.. Life is not so much fun these days. If it doesn't sound like too much of a tortured metaphor, the conceptual thrust of the music, IE the impact of seeing with your own eyes the dream you have lived in your whole life in ruins in front of you... And knowing this is reality. Childhood was bliss, but you're an adult now, and this is the world you have to deal with.. I identify a lot with the character in that game. There's a lot of daddy issues in the game.\n\nSo, that music... When I hear it, I feel two simultaneous emotions. The joy, of spending my childhood with Mike and experiencing all these amazing fun summers playing games and skateboarding and being kids and, well, having somebody there who would teach me about the world and about being a man and who would protect me on that journey. And then the pain, that (As another song on the soundtrack is titled) 'someday the dream will end'. And the pain of his death, and everything that followed. And that that is world I occupy now.\n\nHate to end on a downer but yeah. That song means a hell of a lot to me. As a musician myself, I find it weird the composer will probably never know what an impact it's had on me.\n\n","8117":"I guess this will probably be buried by now, but it means a lot to me.

All of them are compelling in their own ways and they all speak to the confusion that is life.","8253":"I'm going to try to put up different answers than I did the last time I answered one of these. So here goes.\n\n[In Aeroplane Over the Sea by Neutral Milk Hotel.](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=W6H8WcTPnWM) - This song always makes me think of my first love; that overpowering feeling that you've finally met that one person you can't live without. It's a feeling you learn to temper as you get older, but Aeroplane harkens back to that first time you feel it.\n\n[Everyday by Rogue Wave](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iRKX9vU-bIQ) - A Buddy Holly cover from, of all things, a zombie game, Everyday is an absolutely stunningly beautiful rendition of the 50s classic. There's a little nostalgic ache in my heart every time I hear it.\n\n[A Change is Gonna Come by Sam Cooke](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nOYuhLNwh3A) - Same Cooke's greatest song, and for my money, the greatest male vocal performance of all time. Every emotion you can imagine from heartache, to longing, to hope, to joy is crammed into it; an absolute outpouring of feeling from a man who knows that he stands on the cusp of change from all the injustices he's faced to a brighter future.\n\n[Georgia on My Mind by Ray Charles](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yZceOIAh1i0) - This song, at its core, is about being homesick. There are a lot of songs about this, but I've always thought this is the most powerful. Ray was a confused, complicated man who always battled with himself. And his take on \"Georgia on My Mind\" really drives in the notion that on some level, all roads lead back to the beginning.\n\n[Nearly Midnight, Honolulu by Neko Case](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JqSP-zccbys) - A powerful track off of a powerful album, \"Honolulu\" was inspired by the real life encounter detailed in the lyrics. Completely devoid of instruments and sung in gospel style, Case is reaching out to a child treated with the same indifference and disdain that she felt her own parents treated her with. The result is haunting and heartbreaking.\n\n[Let it Be from Across the Universe](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ztkYSJ5jz54) - Speaking of gospel, the rendition of the Beatles \"Let it Be\" from the soundtrack of \"Across the Universe\" is inspired. I hate this movie and most of its soundtrack, but the soulful calls of the choir to carry on in the face of hardship, especially when set to images of race riots and burning streets, are incredibly moving.\n\n[A Little Bit of Everything by Dawes](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yqhRK_g7WJc) - I included this last time, but I always have to represent the Dawes, because they're incredible songwriters who don't get enough love.
